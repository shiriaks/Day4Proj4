            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in
             a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
            a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the 
            more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
             cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
